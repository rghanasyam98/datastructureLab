You’ve heard the chant. You may not have heard of the sport, but you’ve heard the chant. The chant - one that a billion people once lived by; one that would originate from the Wankhede and echo across the city and the seas.<br> It is a name that continues to inspire many, not only in India, but all over the world, to take up the sport. Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar was that cricketer whose personality and aura upstaged any cricketing contest; yet he maintained that he wasn’t greater than than the game. To the people of India, the 5’5” giant of a man was much more than that. He was an emotion; a symbol of hope in a nation that revered him as nothing short of a God. 

Ironically, in the midst of the over-the-top veneration and in spite of the pedestal he has been placed on, it is his humility and the ability to cast it all out that has allowed him to put forth his best performances on the international stage for over two decades.<br> Having played across generations, Tendulkar started playing Test cricket in a white shirt that could just as easily have been used as a school uniform, and scored his last Test hundred in a niche Nike jersey that was impossible to buy over the counter, and would later be auctioned for millions.
